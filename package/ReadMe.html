INScore project

## General information

INScore is an environment for the design of interactive, augmented music scores, oriented towards unconventional uses of music notation and representation, without excluding classical approaches like symbolic music notation. INScore is fully controllable using Open Sound Control [OSC] messages. A scripting language, designed as an extended textual version of OSC messages, allows you to describe scores and interactions in a modular and incremental way. 

This package comes with a lot of sample scripts (`.inscore` files, that are actually text files) that you can try by simple drag & drop to the application window. Note that it supports also direct drag & drop of text.


### Note about the Guido Font

INScore is distributed as a standalone application and should
work as is. However, depending on your platform and on your
operating system version, it may fail to load the music font. 
The symptom is strange glyphs when you display
symbolic music notation.
To solve the problem, you have to install the font manually:

 - the music font file is 'guido2.ttf', it is located along the application
 - to install double click the guido2.ttf file.
   On most of the systems, a font manager will open that contains
   an install button.

Note also that to update an existing font file, it is safer to
uninstall the previous version before installing the new one.

## Links

The INScore project is an open source project. 
For more information, see at:

INScore makes use of the following technologies:

  - the [GUIDOEngine](http://guidolib.sf.net)
  - the GRAME [Faust compiler](https://faust.grame.fr)
  - the IRCAM [Gesture Follower](http://imtr.ircam.fr/imtr/Gesture_Follower)
  - the [Qt5](http://www.qt.io/) cross-platform application and UI framework

Optionnal dependency:

  - the [libMusicXML library](https://github.com/grame-cncm/libmusicxml)
