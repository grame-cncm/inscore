----------------------------------------------------
Version 1.11
- new common queries ('get' message) : count and rcount that give the enclosed objects count
  and a recursive count. The messages are supported at scene and application level as well.
- new 'memimg' object that capture the image of any object hierarchy including scenes

Version 1.08 - 2014-12-15
- new __END__ marker supported to end a script parsing at arbitrary location

----------------------------------------------------

  the node gives statistics about the incoming messages
- crash bug in signal creation corrected: a signal size created with an incorrect stream 
  (e.g. a string value) was 0 and no buffer was allocated.
- extension of the time related events to duration: new 'durEnter' and 'durLeave' watchable events.
- new 'absolutexy' message at scene level to switch to absolute coordinates (in pixels).
- new 'push' and 'pop' messages to store and restore current watched events and associated messages.

 - files dropped on application icon correctly opened when the application is not running
 - supports drag and drop of textual osc message strings
 - osc error stream normalized: the message address is 'error:' or 'warning:'
   followed by a single message string.
 - javascript and lua support: 
   a single persistent context is created at application level and for each scene.
   It allows scripts to reuse previously defined functions and thus design more structured scripts.
   Note: the effect of 'load' message is actually to push the messages on the system stack for
         further evaluation. Thus when including a file containing javascript (or lua), the new 
         language context won't be available to the next messages in the script. The workaround 
         for structured script consists in designing a top level script that only contains 'load'
         messages.
